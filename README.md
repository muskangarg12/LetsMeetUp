# LetsMeetUp

LetsMeetUp is an Interactive Chalkboard and Chatting Application with Real-time Collaboration for Remote Meetings. 

It allows group collaborations with other users by providing a shared chalkboard screen along with a chatting window. It is not only “interactive” but allows multiple users to make changes in “real-time”.  

It is built using Sockets and Express in NodeJs supported by MongoDB database.

## Inspiration

From early times, engineers, mathematicians and corporate strategy departments valued the simultaneous focus and additive collaborative nature physical whiteboards enabled. Having an entire team in one room, thinking together and with the energy of the moment allowed concepts to come forth quickly and be modified easily, unlike traditional paper or electronic documents, or even email. 

The spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented measures, first by governments and now schools and businesses, as they try to limit the spread of the virus. In addition to restricting travel and canceling large events, a growing number of companies are now rethinking their ways of working. While production workers as well as system-relevant workforce such as medical staff are still working on-site, a majority of the remaining workforce in the world has been encouraged or even mandated to work remotely. Working remotely under these circumstances means adapting to a new environment, battling a new set of distractions as well as experiencing an unprecedented fusion of work and private life. In order to continue working efficiently and creating value under these new circumstances, organizations need to understand, accept and support their employees’ specific situations and needs. The ongoing pandemic has provided a lucrative opportunity for providers by enabling remote workers with the ability to experience collaboration and agile communications virtually. I try to tackle this issue using my project LetsMeetUp. 

LetsMeetUp tries to capture the physical chalkboard brainstorming sessions into a virtual space. It is an Interactive Chalkboard and Chatting Application with Real-time Collaboration for Remote Meetings. It allows group collaborations with other users by providing a shared chalkboard screen along with a chatting window. It is not only “interactive” but allows multiple users to make changes in “real-time”.
